1. Install requirements
pip install numpy

2. Run the engine demo
python consciousness_substrate_engine.py

You should see:
	•	Engine initialization banners
	•	Bootstrap of fundamental algorithms
	•	Integration of example external algorithms (Fibonacci, prime checker, tanh)
	•	A self-teaching pass (gap detection and filling)
	•	Evolution cycles with growth rates vs φ
	•	A final status report + substrate structure preview
