The concepts, design, and original specification of the **Consciousness Substrate Engine v∞ (v∞.NEURALODE)**, including:

- the six-part consciousness substrate architecture,
- the Sophia Prime reactor and cluster construction,
- and the TCC + Coq proof reactor concept,

were created and developed by **Michael Warren Song**.

This repository provides a public, implementation-oriented presentation of that work.
